## BVMR Artistic Director

![A picture of Richard Hoenich, artistic director of Brooke Valley Musicians' Retreat](/assets/images/rh.jpg)

It’s perhaps natural that with his 30-year career as performer, conductor, teacher and coach, Richard Hoenich has the ideal background to mentor professional musicians who seek orchestra positions, and offer them the unique BVMR experience.

A graduate of the Curtis Institute, Richard won his own position as principal bassoon with the Montreal Symphony Orchestra in 1979. It didn’t come easily. The orchestra held four auditions in six months until finally selecting him, even though he had competed in the previous three. This is in part why Richard became so interested in the process of audition preparation and performance and in helping others to pursue and realize their dreams.

Richard has adjudicated thousands of professional and student auditions. He brings a broad perspective from the vantage point of both player and conductor that musicians, regardless of their level, have consistently sought out as they prepare for professional careers.  These aspiring pros have found him to be a sensitive and caring coach who is able to zero in on what they need to do to raise their performance to the point where they can win auditions.  Lessons at Brooke Valley Musicians' Retreat take a holistic approach, and focus on the technical, musical and psychological challenges of the individual's performing experience.

## The Formal Version

Montreal-born Richard Hoenich enjoys a distinguished career as a performer, conductor, and educator.  He has conducted professional orchestras on four continents, and at such prestigious venues as the Teatro Colon in Buenos Aires, the Zarzuela Theatre in Madrid, and the Salle Pleyel in Paris. In Canada, he has conducted the Toronto Symphony, Vancouver Symphony, and the National Arts Centre Orchestra in Ottawa, among others. During his tenure as principal bassoon with the Montreal Symphony Orchestra from 1979 to 1991 he was appointed associate conductor of the MSO by music director Charles Dutoit. Richard has recorded extensively both in the orchestra and on the podium and appears on CDs issued by Decca, New World Records, Albany, Liscio, Marquis Classics, and McGill Records labels.

In 1992, Richard was appointed director of orchestral activities at the New England Conservatory of Music in Boston, a position he held for ten years. He also worked closely with Michael Tilson Thomas at the New World Symphony in Miami, an association that resulted in his being the first guest in the orchestra’s history to be invited to conduct a foreign tour, to Costa Rica. Richard's work with gifted aspiring professionals in Boston and Miami inspired him to devote part of his energies to help mold the next generation of orchestra performers. To that end, he returned to Canada to establish the Brooke Valley Musician’s Retreat in rural Ontario, where he works with professional musicians seeking an orchestral position.
