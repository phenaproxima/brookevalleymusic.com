This is a special place. Secluded, rural, private and distraction-free, BVMR is designed for instrumentalists who want to reach the next level in their career development.

> "Brooke Valley Musician's Retreat is truly an inspiring place. I learned techniques that improved my concentration, increased my confidence while performing under pressure, and gave me more insight into the music I was playing. I applied what Richard Hoenich taught me at my next professional audition and I won the job!"

> "I first knew Richard Hoenich as a gifted and very talented musician.  Over the twelve years he performed as Principal Bassoon with the Montreal Symphony, he proved indeed to be an artist of very high calibre and musicianship. In his career path, he is now well known to guide, inspire and motivate young aspiring musicians."

> "As a young player in Nebraska, I grew up listening to Richard and his wind colleagues on the amazing recordings of the Montreal Symphony Orchestra.  I feel I owe a great deal of my own approach to the artistry I gleaned from them.  Now that Richard has established his rural retreat for musicians, I have no doubt that anyone who can spend some quality one-on-one time with him in the bucolic countryside setting will come away inspired, motivated and -- most importantly -- better equipped to pursue their career dreams."
